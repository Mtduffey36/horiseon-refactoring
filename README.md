# Horiseon Refactoring 
## **Scope of Work:**
**_My objective was to refactor the original code without making any changes to the existing product. I did that by:_**
* Changing tags in the HTML document to be more semantic
* Condensed repeated CSS selectors
* Adding alternates for image sources in the event of a broken link
* Adding comments in the code to explain certain changes
